# Write a script that gets the name and age of 3 people (name, age)
# Store them in an array of hashes named people e.g. {name: 'Adrian', age: 29}
# Strip trailing chars of input, look for the appropriate function here:
# http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html

#Â Your script starts here
people = []
person = {}

(1..3).each do |n|
  puts "Name: "
  person[:name] = gets().strip
  puts "Age: "
  person[:age] = gets().to_i
  people << person
end

# Your script ends here

puts people.inspect

# !! Bonus
# Store the age in the hash as an integer
